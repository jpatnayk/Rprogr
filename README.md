Rprogramming
============
### Introduction

This is a repository of the R programming assignments. 

### First Programming Assignment

### Second Programming Assignment

The second programming assignment is to write an R function which is able to cache potentially 
time-consuming computations. For example, finding the inverse  of a matrix is time-consuming. 
If the contents of a matrix are not changing, it may make sense to cache the value so that 
when we need it again, it can be looked up in the cache rather than re-computing it.
