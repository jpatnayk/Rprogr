Rprogramming
============
### Introduction

This is a repository of the R programming assignments. 

### First Programming Assignment

### Second Programming Assignment

The second programming assignment is to write an R function which is able to 
cache potentially time-consuming computations. For example, finding the inverse  
of a matrix is time-consuming. If the contents of a matrix are not changing, it 
may make sense to cache the value so that when we need it again, it can be looked 
up in the cache rather than re-computing it. 

Grading

This assignment is graded via peer assessment.
